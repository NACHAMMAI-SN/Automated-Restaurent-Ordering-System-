# Automated-Restaurent-Ordering-System-
The project aims to automate the food ordering and billing processes in restaurant management while enhancing the dining experience for customers. The system replaces traditional manual ordering methods with a smart ordering interface. It features a user-friendly setup where customers can navigate the menu on a touchscreen display, select items, and confirm orders directly. The order data is transmitted to the kitchen, ensuring seamless communication and minimizing errors caused by handwriting or misunderstandings.

Key components of the system include:

Arduino-based Setup: The use of Arduino microcontrollers allows for easy customization and programming.
Touchscreen Displays: These screens provide a visually appealing and efficient menu navigation experience.
Keypad Integration: A 4x4 keypad is employed for menu navigation and order selection.
Wireless Communication: The system leverages wireless data transmission to ensure efficient and real-time updates.
Real-Time Feedback: Displays in the kitchen provide real-time order details to chefs for accurate and timely preparation.
The system is designed to be cost-effective, easy to operate, and environmentally friendly, eliminating the need for paper-based menus and reducing manual errors. By automating routine tasks such as order-taking and bill generation, restaurant staff can focus more on customer service, thereby increasing overall efficiency and customer satisfaction.
